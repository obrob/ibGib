MeaningStudier has to know how much of the meaning we understand.  It should have already heard how much
the MultiLineTextsStudier said the user understood of the MLT.  If not, it will have to assess this itself,
but we will assume it heard it for now.  Using this % understood (% known), it will choose a phrase
aggregate size, first publishing a thinking event.  Once the aggregate size is chosen, it will parse
the MLT into aggregate phrases of this size and analyze how much of these phrases it thinks the user knows.
Then based on this, it will choose which phrase to present to the user.  For now, this will be in the form of 
a Q & A.  Once chosen, it will publish an acting event and then publish an offer.  At this point, the 
MeaningStudier is done, though it may listen for feedback with that offer. (future, it can start anticipating 
feedbacks and make ready its next offer).
